- **Limitation**: Insights remain isolated and context-specific

**Recursive Intelligence Loop**: Analysis ‚Üí Systematize ‚Üí Teach ‚Üí Amplify ‚Üí Enhanced Analysis
- **Growth Rate**: Exponential improvement (~15% per cycle)
- **Advantage**: Meta-insights enhance the learning process itself

### **Compound Intelligence Effects**
Each complete cycle doesn't just add knowledge - it **enhances the capacity for strategic thinking**:

- **Cycle 1**: Basic strategic pattern recognition
- **Cycle 2**: Meta-pattern awareness and cross-domain transfer
- **Cycle 3**: System-level thinking and recursive improvement understanding
- **Cycle 4**: Civilization-level impact modeling and wisdom acceleration mastery
