# Cursor AI Interaction Styles Framework
*For CADIS Developer Intelligence Analysis*

## Overview
This framework defines different styles of AI interaction to help CADIS provide more accurate coaching and assessment. Not all developers use AI the same way - understanding these patterns is crucial for proper coaching.

---

## üéØ **Interaction Style Categories**

### **1. üèóÔ∏è STRATEGIC ARCHITECT** (Leadership/Executive Style)
**Example: Current conversation analysis**

**Characteristics:**
- **High-level strategic thinking** - "proceed and make sure CADIS is using developer information properly"
- **System-wide vision** - Thinks about entire ecosystems and integrations
- **Iterative refinement** - "that's cool but should also be getting individual developer info"
- **Quality control** - "make sure it is doing that as well outside of just usage"
- **Resource optimization** - "since there are so many, analyze and see if we need to optimize"
- **Problem diagnosis** - "what do it mean if connection is maxed out..? help me understand real issue"

**Conversation Patterns:**
```
User: "proceed and make sure that CADIS is using the developer information properly"
AI: [Implements technical solution]
User: "yes proceed and analyze based on all that data"
AI: [Provides analysis]
User: "but are the chats being analyzed.. what if no info is picked up from it..?"
```

**Key Indicators:**
- Uses "proceed" frequently (delegation/direction)
- Asks clarifying questions about system behavior
- Focuses on end-to-end outcomes rather than implementation details
- Provides high-level requirements and lets AI figure out technical approach
- Iteratively refines scope and requirements

---

### **2. üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTER** (Developer Style)
**Example: Most current developers**

**Characteristics:**
- **Specific technical problems** - "How do I fix this React component error?"
- **Code-focused solutions** - Shares code snippets and asks for fixes
- **Step-by-step guidance** - Wants detailed implementation instructions
- **Debugging assistance** - "This isn't working, help me debug"
- **Feature implementation** - "How do I add this functionality?"

**Conversation Patterns:**
```
User: "I'm getting this error: [error message]. How do I fix it?"
AI: [Provides solution]
User: "That didn't work, here's my current code: [code block]"
AI: [Debugs specific issue]
User: "Perfect! Now how do I add validation to this?"
```

**Key Indicators:**
- Shares specific error messages and code
- Asks "how do I" questions frequently
- Focuses on immediate technical problems
- Requests step-by-step instructions
- Iterates on specific implementation details

---

### **3. üìö LEARNING EXPLORER** (Student Style)

**Characteristics:**
- **Conceptual understanding** - "Why does this work this way?"
- **Best practices inquiry** - "What's the recommended approach?"
- **Knowledge building** - "Explain how this pattern works"
- **Comparative analysis** - "What's the difference between X and Y?"
- **Theoretical exploration** - "When should I use this vs that?"

**Conversation Patterns:**
```
User: "Can you explain how React hooks work conceptually?"
AI: [Provides explanation]
User: "Why is useState better than class components?"
AI: [Compares approaches]
User: "What are the best practices for state management?"
```

**Key Indicators:**
- Asks "why" and "how" questions frequently
- Requests explanations and comparisons
- Seeks understanding of underlying concepts
- Asks about best practices and patterns
- Focuses on learning rather than immediate problem-solving

---

### **4. üöÄ RAPID PROTOTYPER** (Startup Style)

**Characteristics:**
- **Quick solutions** - "What's the fastest way to implement X?"
- **MVP focus** - "I need something basic that works"
- **Time-sensitive** - "I need this done quickly"
- **Pragmatic approach** - "Good enough for now, we'll optimize later"
- **Resource constraints** - "What's the simplest approach?"

**Conversation Patterns:**
```
User: "I need to quickly add user authentication. What's the fastest approach?"
AI: [Suggests quick solution]
User: "Perfect, that works. Now I need basic CRUD operations, simplest way?"
AI: [Provides rapid solution]
User: "Great! Can you help me deploy this quickly?"
```

---

### **5. üé® CREATIVE COLLABORATOR** (Design-Thinking Style)

**Characteristics:**
- **Brainstorming** - "What are some creative approaches to X?"
- **Alternative exploration** - "What other ways could we solve this?"
- **User experience focus** - "How can we make this more intuitive?"
- **Innovation seeking** - "What's a unique way to implement this?"
- **Holistic thinking** - Considers multiple perspectives and stakeholders

## üß† **CADIS Analysis Framework**

### **Detection Patterns for Each Style**

#### **Strategic Architect Detection:**
```javascript
const strategicPatterns = {
  directionGiving: /\b(proceed|implement|ensure|make sure|analyze|optimize)\b/gi,
  systemThinking: /\b(ecosystem|integration|overall|comprehensive|end-to-end)\b/gi,
  qualityControl: /\b(verify|confirm|test|validate|check)\b/gi,
  iterativeRefinement: /\b(but|however|also|additionally|what about)\b/gi,
  problemDiagnosis: /\b(what do|why|understand|explain|real issue)\b/gi
};
```

#### **Technical Implementer Detection:**
```javascript
const implementerPatterns = {
  problemSolving: /\b(error|bug|issue|fix|debug|not working)\b/gi,
  codeSharing: /```[\s\S]*?```|`[^`]+`/g,
  howToQuestions: /\b(how do i|how can i|how to)\b/gi,
  specificRequests: /\b(add|implement|create|build|make)\b/gi
};
```

#### **Learning Explorer Detection:**
```javascript
const learnerPatterns = {
  conceptualQuestions: /\b(why|how does|what is|explain|understand)\b/gi,
  bestPractices: /\b(best practice|recommended|should|better way)\b/gi,
  comparisons: /\b(difference|compare|versus|vs|better than)\b/gi,
  theoretical: /\b(concept|theory|principle|pattern|approach)\b/gi
};
```
