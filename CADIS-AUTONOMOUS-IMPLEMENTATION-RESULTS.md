### 🎯 Tony Stark's FRIDAY/JARVIS Achieved

CADIS now operates exactly like Tony Stark's AI assistants:

1. **Give it resources** (API keys, credentials) → **It expands capabilities**
2. **Request implementations** → **It delivers production-ready code**
3. **Learns from every interaction** → **Gets smarter and faster**
4. **Operates autonomously** → **Minimal human intervention required**
5. **Maintains quality standards** → **Production-ready by default**

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 24 Hours)
1. **Test Preview Environment** - Validate the implementation at the preview URL
2. **Review Generated Code** - Examine the autonomous code quality
3. **Approve Production Deployment** - Move to production if satisfied
4. **Document Patterns** - Capture what CADIS learned for future use

### Short-term Expansion (Next Week)
1. **Add More API Keys** - Give CADIS access to Google, AWS, other services
2. **Test AI-Callers Scenario** - Let CADIS implement the Bland.ai integration
